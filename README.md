This is the repository I created as my final assignment in Coursera Course Data Scientist Tool Box, called "Assemble your toolbox"
Hello! Thank you very much for reviewing my assignment!
Hope you'll had a good time learning how to use all those tools this course showed as much as I did.
## I wish you a great week for Brazil!
